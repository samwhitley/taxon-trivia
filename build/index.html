      <h4>How to Play</h4>

      <p>
        Taxonomy is the categorization of living things into groups based on shared characteristics and common descent. To start this game, you pick a taxon, or grouping of organisms. Next, you are presented with photographs of representative animals and are given the name of a smaller grouping within the taxon. Your goal is to choose the animal that belongs to this smaller group.

        About this Game
      </h4>

      <p>
        Being able to identify key features and relationships between taxa is an important skill for those who wish to study a particular group in detail. All content for this game is sourced from the Encyclopedia of Life API - none of the animal pictures or written descriptions are hard coded into this app. Therefore, this game can easily be repurposed with new categories, extending the educational possibilities.
